# Computional Statistics Assignment 2 - Maastricht University

The final submission in the form of a report should be one single pdf that you can upload to Canvas.
One submission per group. The group can have a maximum of 5 members. We recommend to keep the
same groups from assignment 1. Keep the report short. The main text should not exceed three pages.
You can add an appendix to mention details that you find important. Otherwise, the structure of the
report is up to you. You might want to add a link to your GitHub repository with your code.
